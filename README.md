- Movie Trailer Website - using Python

This project focuses on building a MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE where users can see the list of various movies and watch their trailers.
The variables used in the code stores a list of movie title, movie description, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. 

This Movie Trailer Website is made using Python version 2.7.9.
This projects mainly comprises of  _3_  python files namely- **media.py** _(our main class)_, **entertainment_centre.py** and **fresh tomatoes.py**. 

The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a structure to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

The entertainment_center.py file creates multiple instances _(objects)_ of that Movie Class to represent different movies and groups all the instances together in a list.

The Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, 
which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
